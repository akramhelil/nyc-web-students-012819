### Overview

Let's try to model a Salon Domain
- models & relationship
  - Salon
    - stylist
    - name
  - Customer
    - name
  - Appointment
    - salon
    - customer
    - rating
    - price

Some things to keep in mind as we try to answer deliverables
- what methods would help us get the information that is relevant
- where does the information live that we need and where we begin
- how do we test if it works
